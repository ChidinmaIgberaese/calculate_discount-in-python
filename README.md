# calculate_discount-in-python

Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

# How it works:

The calculate_discount function checks if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
If true, it applies the discount and returns the final price.
If the discount is less than 20%, it simply returns the original price.
The user is prompted to enter the price and discount percentage, and the script outputs the appropriate final price.

# Example

Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
After applying the discount, the final price is: $75.00
